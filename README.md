# README
This repository contains a Simulated Annealing (SA) solver for the random K-SAT problem. The implementation was developed in the context of the Computer Programming course, where I serve as a Teaching Assistant.
It provides a configurable SA pipeline (temperature schedules, restarts, reproducible seeds) and a simple CLI to load/generate random K-SAT instances and report solution quality and runtime metrics.
